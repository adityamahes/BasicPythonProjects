How does email work?
    1. Behind the scenes, your mail server (gmail) will receive your mail.
    2. It is then transferred to the recipients email server
    3. The recipients email server stores the email until the recipient opens mail
    4. Once the email is opened the email is downloaded.
   * All of this it relies on SMTP, which contains all the rules that determine hw the email is sent
    *SMTP is basically the postman, the servers are the post offices, and the recipient's computer is the postbox.
